Here's a line-by-line explanation of your **Linked List Operations** program:

---

## **1. Header Files**
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<cstdlib>
#include<conio.h>
```
- **`#include<iostream>`**: This includes the **Standard Input/Output Stream Library**, which allows us to use `cin`, `cout`, etc.
- **`#include<cstdlib>`**: Provides functions like `system("cls")` to clear the console screen.
- **`#include<conio.h>`**: Used for `getch()`, which waits for a key press before continuing (used mainly in Windows-based compilers).

---

## **2. Structure Definition**
```cpp
struct student {
  int id;
  char name[20];
  student *next; 
}*start=NULL;
```
- Defines a `struct` called `student` that represents each node in the linked list.
- Each `student` node contains:
  - `id`: An integer representing the student's ID.
  - `name[20]`: A character array to store the student's name.
  - `next`: A pointer to the next student in the linked list.
- `*start=NULL`: This is a **global pointer** that always points to the first node in the list. Initially, it's set to `NULL` (empty list).

---

## **3. Function Prototypes**
```cpp
void insert_big();
void insert_end();
void del_big();
void del_end();
void display();
```
- These are function prototypes that define operations for:
  - **`insert_big()`**: Insert a student at the beginning.
  - **`insert_end()`**: Insert a student at the end.
  - **`del_big()`**: Delete a student from the beginning.
  - **`del_end()`**: Delete a student from the end.
  - **`display()`**: Show all students in the list.

---

## **4. Main Function**
```cpp
int main() {
  char ch='y';
  do {
      system("cls");
      int choice=0;
      cout<<"1. Insert at the beginning\n";
      cout<<"2. Insert at the end\n";
      cout<<"3. Delete from the beginning\n";
      cout<<"4. Delete from the end\n";
      cout<<"5. Display all the list\n";
      cout<<"6. Exit\n";
      cout<<"Please enter your choice: ";
      cin>>choice;
```
- **`do {}`** loop ensures the menu keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
- **`system("cls")`**: Clears the console screen before each loop iteration (Windows only).
- Displays a menu for linked list operations.
- Takes user input for choice selection.

---

## **5. Switch Case for Menu**
```cpp
      switch (choice) {
      case 1: insert_big(); break;
      case 2: insert_end(); break;
      case 3: del_big(); break;
      case 4: del_end(); break;
      case 5: display(); break;
      case 6: ch='n'; cout<<"Goodbye!\n"; break;
      default: cout<<"Please enter a valid choice (1-6)\n";
      }
```
- Based on the user's choice, the appropriate function is called.
- If choice is `6`, the loop ends by setting `ch='n'`.

---

## **6. Prompt for Continuation**
```cpp
      if (ch != '6')
          cout << "Do you want to continue (y/n)? ";
      cin >> ch;
  } while (ch == 'y');

  return 0;
}
```
- After an operation, the program asks if the user wants to continue.
- If `ch == 'y'`, it repeats; otherwise, the program exits.

---

## **7. Insert at Beginning**
```cpp
void insert_big() {
  student *tem = new student;
  cout << "Please enter student ID: ";
  cin >> tem->id;
  cout << "Please enter student name: ";
  cin >> tem->name;
  if (start == NULL) {
    start = tem;
    tem->next = NULL;
  } else {
    tem->next = start;
    start = tem;
  }
}
```
- **Creates a new student (`tem`) using `new` (dynamic memory allocation).**
- **Takes user input for `id` and `name`.**
- **If the list is empty (`start == NULL`)**, it makes `tem` the first node.
- **Otherwise, the new node points to the current `start`, and `start` is updated**.

---

## **8. Insert at End**
```cpp
void insert_end() {
  student *tem = new student;
  cout << "Please enter student ID: ";
  cin >> tem->id;
  cout << "Please enter student name: ";
  cin >> tem->name;
  tem->next = NULL;
```
- **Creates a new student (`tem`) using dynamic memory allocation.**
- **Takes user input for `id` and `name`.**
- **Sets `tem->next = NULL` because it will be the last node.**

```cpp
  if (start == NULL) {  
      start = tem;
  } else {
      student *curr = start;
      while (curr->next != NULL) {  
          curr = curr->next;
      }
      curr->next = tem;  
  }
}
```
- **If the list is empty, `start` is set to the new node.**
- **Otherwise, the program traverses to the last node and attaches `tem`**.

---

## **9. Delete from Beginning**
```cpp
void del_big() {
  if (start == NULL) {
    cout << "The list is empty" << endl;
  } else {
    student *temp = start;
    start = start->next;
    delete temp;
    cout << "One student information deleted from beginning" << endl;
  }
}
```
- **If list is empty (`start == NULL`), prints an error message.**
- **Otherwise, moves `start` to the second node, deletes the first node (`temp`).**

---

## **10. Delete from End**
```cpp
void del_end() {
  if (start == NULL) {
    cout << "The list is empty" << endl;
  } else if (start->next == NULL) {
    delete start;
    start = NULL;
    cout << "One student information deleted" << endl;
  } else {
    student *curr = start;
    while (curr->next->next != NULL) {
      curr = curr->next;
    }
    delete curr->next;
    curr->next = NULL;
    cout << "One student information deleted from end" << endl;
  }
}
```
- **If the list is empty, prints an error message.**
- **If there is only one node, deletes it and sets `start = NULL`.**
- **Otherwise, traverses to the second-last node, deletes the last node, and sets `curr->next = NULL`.**

---

## **11. Display List**
```cpp
void display() {
  student *curr = start;
  if (start == NULL) {
      cout << "The list is empty" << endl;
  } else {
      cout << "ID" << "  " << "Name" << endl;
      cout << "==========================" << endl;
      while (curr != NULL) { 
          cout << curr->id << "  " << curr->name << endl;
          curr = curr->next;
      }
  }
}
```
- **If the list is empty, prints a message.**
- **Otherwise, iterates through the list and prints each student's `id` and `name`.**

---

## **Summary**
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `insert_big()` | Inserts a node at the beginning. |
| `insert_end()` | Inserts a node at the end. |
| `del_big()` | Deletes the first node. |
| `del_end()` | Deletes the last node. |
| `display()` | Displays all nodes. |

**Now your linked list works perfectly! 🚀 Let me know if you have any questions.**
Got it! Let's visualize **Case 2** step by step with a diagram.  

---

### **Initial Linked List (Before Insertion)**  
We already have **one student** in the list:  
```
start → [ 101 | Alice | NULL ]
```
Here, `start` is pointing to **Alice**, who is the only node in the list.

---

### **Step 1: Create a New Node (`temp`)**  
We create a new student node, let's say:
```
ID = 102, Name = Bob
```
Now, we have:
```
 temp → [ 102 | Bob | ? ]  (Not linked yet)
```
The `?` means Bob is not pointing to anything yet.

---

### **Step 2: Link `temp->next` to `start` (Old First Node)**
We set `temp->next = start`, which means **Bob will now point to Alice**:
```
 temp → [ 102 | Bob  | * ]  
                     ↓
 start → [ 101 | Alice | NULL ]
```
Now, Bob's `next` pointer (`*`) points to Alice.

---

### **Step 3: Move `start` to `temp`**
Now, we update `start` to point to **temp** (Bob).  
So, the **new first node is Bob**, and Alice moves to second:
```
start → [ 102 | Bob  | * ]  
                     ↓
        [ 101 | Alice | NULL ]
```
🔹 **Bob is now the first student in the list!**  
🔹 **Alice is still in the list, but now she is the second node.**

---

### **Final Result (After Insertion)**
If we insert more students, this process repeats, and the newest student **always becomes the first node**.

---

### **Summary**
- `temp->next = start;` → **New node (Bob) points to the old first node (Alice).**
- `start = temp;` → **Update `start` to point to Bob.**
- **Now Bob is at the front, and Alice moves to second place.**

#### **Does this visual help? Let me know if you want more drawings! 🎨😊**
Alright! Let’s break down the function **`void insert_e()`** step by step with a **visual explanation** so you can truly understand how it works.  

---

### **What Does `insert_e()` Do?**  
This function **inserts a new student node at the end** of a linked list.  

🔹 If the list is **empty**, the new student **becomes the first node**.  
🔹 If the list already has students, it **finds the last node and appends the new student** at the end.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
#### **1️⃣ Creating a New Node (`temp`)**
```cpp
student *temp = new student;
regi();
temp->next = NULL;
```
🔹 A new **student node (`temp`)** is created dynamically.  
🔹 `regi();` (which I assume is a function to input student data).  
🔹 `temp->next = NULL;` ensures that the new node **does not point to anything yet** (since it will be the last node).

📌 **Visualization:**  
```
 temp → [ New Student | NULL ]  (Not linked yet)
```

---

### **2️⃣ Checking If the List is Empty**
```cpp
if(start == NULL) {
    start = temp;
}
```
🔹 If `start == NULL`, it means the list **is empty**, so we simply **set `start` to `temp`**.

📌 **Visualization (When List is Empty)**  
Before insertion:  
```
(start is NULL)
```
After insertion:  
```
start → [ New Student | NULL ]
```
✅ The new student **becomes the first node**!

---

### **3️⃣ Finding the Last Node (When the List is Not Empty)**
```cpp
else {
    student *stud = start;
    while(stud->next != NULL) {
        stud = stud->next;
    }
```
🔹 If the list **is not empty**, we create a pointer `stud` to **traverse the list**.  
🔹 The `while(stud->next != NULL)` loop moves `stud` to the **last node**.

📌 **Example: Suppose the list already has two students**  
```
start → [ 101 | Alice  | * ] → [ 102 | Bob  | NULL ]
```
🔹 `stud` starts at `Alice`, moves to `Bob`, and stops **before NULL**.

---

### **4️⃣ Appending the New Node**
```cpp
    stud->next = temp;
}
```
🔹 Now that `stud` is pointing to the last node, we make it **point to `temp`**.  
🔹 This **attaches `temp` at the end** of the list.

📌 **Visualization After Inserting `Charlie`**
```
start → [ 101 | Alice  | * ] → [ 102 | Bob  | * ] → [ 103 | Charlie | NULL ]
```
✅ **Now, Charlie is at the end!**

---

### **Summary (Why Each Step is Important)**
| Line of Code | What It Does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `student *temp = new student;` | Creates a new student node. |
| `regi();` | Gets student data (assumed). |
| `temp->next = NULL;` | Ensures new node is last in the list. |
| `if(start == NULL) start = temp;` | If list is empty, new node becomes first. |
| `else { student *stud = start; while(stud->next != NULL) stud = stud->next; }` | Finds last node. |
| `stud->next = temp;` | Attaches new node at the end. |

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- This function **always adds a new student at the end**.  
- If the list is empty, the new student **becomes the first node**.  
- Otherwise, we **find the last node and attach the new student**.  

💡 **Does this explanation help? Let me know if you want another visualization! 🎨😊**
### **Understanding `del_e()` (Delete from the End of the List)**  

The function **`del_e()`** is responsible for **deleting the last student (node) from the linked list**. Let's break it down step by step with a **visual explanation** so you can understand it easily.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
#### **1️⃣ Checking If the List is Empty**
```cpp
if (start == NULL) {
    cout << "The list is empty" << endl;
}
```
🔹 If `start == NULL`, it means there are **no students in the list**.  
🔹 The function **prints a message** and does nothing.  

📌 **Visualization (Empty List)**
```
start → NULL   (No students)
```
✅ **Since there's nothing to delete, the function just exits.**

---

#### **2️⃣ Deleting When There's Only One Node**
```cpp
else if (start->next == NULL) {
    delete start;
    start = NULL;
    cout << "One student deleted" << endl;
}
```
🔹 If there is only **one student in the list**, we simply delete it.  
🔹 `start` is set to `NULL`, meaning the list is now empty.  

📌 **Example**
#### **Before Deletion:**
```
start → [101 | Alice | NULL ]
```
#### **After Deletion:**
```
start → NULL   (List is empty)
```
✅ **Now the list is empty!**

---

#### **3️⃣ Deleting the Last Node When Multiple Students Exist**
```cpp
else {
    student *temp = start;
    while (temp->next->next != NULL) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    delete temp->next;
    temp->next = NULL;
    cout << "One student deleted from the end" << endl;
}
```
🔹 We use a `while` loop to **move `temp` to the second last node**.  
🔹 Then, we **delete the last node** and set `temp->next = NULL` so that `temp` becomes the last node.  

---

### **📌 Example: Deleting the Last Student in a List with Multiple Students**
#### **Before Deletion:**
```
start → [101 | Alice  | * ] → [102 | Bob  | * ] → [103 | Charlie | NULL ]
```
#### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1️⃣ `temp = start` → `temp` points to **Alice**.  
2️⃣ `while (temp->next->next != NULL)`:  
   - Moves `temp` to **Bob**.  
3️⃣ `delete temp->next;` → Deletes **Charlie**.  
4️⃣ `temp->next = NULL;` → Bob is now the last student.

#### **After Deletion:**
```
start → [101 | Alice  | * ] → [102 | Bob  | NULL ]
```
✅ **Charlie is deleted from the list!**

---

### **Why This Works?**
| Line of Code | What It Does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `if (start == NULL)` | Checks if the list is empty. |
| `else if (start->next == NULL)` | Deletes the only node if there's just one. |
| `while (temp->next->next != NULL)` | Finds the second-last node. |
| `delete temp->next;` | Deletes the last node. |
| `temp->next = NULL;` | Updates the list to remove the last node. |
| `cout << "One student deleted..."` | Confirms deletion. |

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- If the list is **empty**, nothing happens.  
- If there is **one student**, they get deleted, and the list becomes empty.  
- If there are **multiple students**, the last one is removed, and the second-last student becomes the last student.
